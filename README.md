## Projects
###  House Price Prediction

In the House Price Prediction machine learning project, historical housing data was used to train a predictive model. Features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and amenities were considered. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and algorithms like linear regression, decision trees etc were employed for model training. The trained model was then validated using the test set to ensure accuracy. Once validated, the model was able to predict house prices based on input features. This project helped real estate stakeholders, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions by providing reliable estimates of property values.

### Heart Attack Prediction

In the Heart Attack Prediction machine learning project, a dataset encompassing vital medical information is meticulously collected and preprocessed. Key features influencing heart attacks are selected, and a binary classification model, such as logistic regression or decision trees, is chosen. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and validate the model, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are employed to assess the model's performance. The ultimate goal is to deploy a robust predictive model capable of early detection, contributing to proactive healthcare interventions and potentially saving lives by forecasting the likelihood of a heart attack based on comprehensive health metrics.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

A large dataset of transactional data is painstakingly preprocessed and engineered to highlight critical traits suggestive of fraud in the Fraud Detection machine learning project. High-performance techniques, like neural networks or random forests, are chosen to create a model that effectively classifies fraud. To enable thorough model training and validation, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. To make sure the model is accurate, performance evaluation criteria including F1 score, precision, and recall are used. The end game is to implement a real-time system that keeps an eye on all transactions and can quickly identify and stop fraudulent activity. This would increase the security of financial transactions and reduce potential hazards.
